# Panel Files

The front panel is made of an aluminum sheet, with individual 0.8mm thick PCB panels for each major circuit block.

The PCB panels are a cheap way to get a decent looking front panel. Using individual panels keeps the cost of each panel down, and allows for flexibility: if a circuit block needs to be modified in the future, we can remake just the individual panel section, and not the whole front panel.

See the individual directories for details.
