## This sandbox is a place to visualize the PCBs and how they fit together.

As board layout progresses I just copy-paste the PCBs into a KiCad project and place them in the correct spot relative to the other boards.

### The purpose is:
- ensure that the inter-board headers line up fairly well
- catch any obvious mechanical or spacing issues

### Boards so far (more to come):
