## Status:

A complete synthesizer has been built with the current documents here. This instrument has been road tested on a few gigs. The current files represent a working instrument.

There are a few small PCB kludges required, and some potential future enhancements.
See the `github Issues` and `github Discussions` for little things that could be improved and an idea of what may change in the future.

The synth is constructed with semi-independent PCBs and panels for the major circuit blocks, which allows for gradually upgrading the components over time.
