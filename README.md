# josh_Ox_ribbon_synth
Ribbon synth for Josh Oxford featuring a single VCO with two sub-oscillators, two state-variable filters, ring-modulator, VCA, three ADSR's, and a versatile modulation oscillator.

This synth is in the middle of a major refurb. All the old handmade protoboards and rats-nest handwiring are being replaced by printed circuit boards.

## Goals
- Redo all the handmade protopboards and rats nest wiring with nice printed pcbs
- Generate good quality documentation
- Add any mods that Ox wants which are feasable
- Maintain the general architecture, but make circuit improvements/updates/changes where appropriate

## Status
All major boards are built and tested.

The main VCO board requires a couple minor pcb kludges to make the Ring Modulator work, but otherwise all systems are working.
