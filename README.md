## Status:

A complete synthesizer has been built with the current documents here. This instrument has been road tested on a few gigs, and all the systems work.

However, I would probably not build another one with the current files
- There are a number of enhancements that are under consideration
- The main VCO pcb has a couple of errors which require minor kludges

See the `github Issues` for little things that could be improved and an idea of what may change in the future.

That said, one could absolutely build an instrument with the files as they exist now, and have a working device that is fun to play. 

The synth is construced with semi-independent PCBs and panels for the major circuit blocks, which allows for gradually upgrading the components over time.
